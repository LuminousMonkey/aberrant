# Aberrant

This library is based off [StackExchange.Exceptional](https://github.com/NickCraver/StackExchange.Exceptional) by [Nick Craver](https://nickcraver.com/). It is an error handler for logging errors to SQL (currently PostgreSQL is only supported).

It is not a port, it is my own poor attempt to try and take ideas from another open source project.

## Usage

Not as of yet, too early.
